enzlig_tools
============

Protocols and tools to run (automated) atomistic simulations of enzyme-ligand systems

Minimal software requirements:
- AmberTools14 (see www.ambermd.org - Amber14.pdf manual has instructions for installation)

Several utitilies/programs from AmberTools14 are used.
Currently, the protocols are only available as bash-scripts (for Linux or Mac OS X).
All bash-scripts require awk & sed.
NOTE: current bash-scripts are NOT fully POSIX compliant.

Tested with:
- GNU Awk 3.1.7 (Linux)
- GNU sed version 4.2.1 (Linux)
- awk version 20070501 (Mac OS)

###Download the repository on Linux/UNIX/Mac :   

First ensure that git is installed. Instructions are [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads) 

Command-line:

1) In the right-hand corner of this page, there is a title "HTTPS clone URL" with a URL in a field below it.
Copy this link 

2) Go to the command line on your Linux/Mac and cd to a suitable location to create the Repository
Then type:

git clone https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/enzlig_tools.git

On some UNIX clusters you may need to use SSH rather than HTTPS to clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:marcvanderkamp/enzlig_tools.git

3) This will download the Repository enzlig_tools for use on your local computer. 

4) Several scripts in the current repository require you to set the ENZLIG environment variable to indicate the location of the repository. 

In bash:

export ENZLIG=/my/path/to/enzlig_tools/

In tcsh/csh:

setenv ENZLIG /my/path/to/enzlig_tools/


## Available scripts
### prep.sh
Takes enzyme-ligand pdb file and generates ligand parameters, adds hydrogens, adds solvent (sphere), generates Amber topology/coordinate files.

  Usage:  
  prep.sh \<pdb file\> \<ligand name\> \<net ligand charge\> [\<non-standard residue name; if multiple, put in "quotes"\>]
- The pdb file should contain 1 (non-protein) ligand, WITH all hydrogens added!
- Uses the following AmberTools14 programs: antechamber (& sqm), prmchk2, pdb4amber, reduce, tleap 
- Ideally requires installation of propka31 (and put in $PATH)
- Extensive comments in prep.sh provide more in-depth explanation of the steps in the protocol, etc.

### struct.sh
Takes the topology/coordinate files generated by prep.sh and performs brief simulated-annealing and minimisation protocol (to optimize structure).

  Usage:
  struct.sh \<pdb file\> \<ligand name\> [all other input is currently ignored]
- Requires prep.sh to be run successfully first (and directory/filenames to stay as they were when prep.sh was run)
- Should be run in the same directory where prep.sh was run
